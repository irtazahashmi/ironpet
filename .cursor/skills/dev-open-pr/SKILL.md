  Create GitHub pull requests for ironpet (macOS desktop pet: Swift app,
  agent hooks, ACP chat, bundled adapters, scripts) with gh, including branch
  checks, the CI gates, a conventional title, and a What / How / Verification
  body with safety and privacy notes. Use when the user asks to open, create,
  or prepare a PR, or to push the current branch and open a PR for it.

# Open Pull Request

Create merge-ready pull requests for ironpet: the SwiftPM app in `Sources/IronPet` with its XCTest suite, and the tooling in `sidecar/`, `scripts/` and `tools/`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every PR, but run the gates locally before opening it rather than waiting for CI.

## Use this skill when

- The user asks to open, create, or prepare a PR.
- The user asks to push the current branch and open a PR for it.
- A change is complete and needs to be sent for review.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is just committing locally (no PR yet).
- The user wants to update an existing PR's description or CI. Use `gh pr edit` / `gh pr view` directly.
- The change has not been reviewed for merge readiness yet. Run `.cursor/skills/dev-code-review/SKILL.md` first, or at minimum the gates below. If a gate fails, stop and report it. Do not open the PR unless the user explicitly asks for a draft anyway.

## Minimum gates

The same checks CI runs, from the repo root:

| Branch touches | Run |
|---|---|
| Anything in `Sources/`, `Tests/`, `Package.swift` | `swift build` and `swift test` |
| `Package.swift`, `sidecar/`, `tools/`, `Resources/`, `scripts/bundle.sh` | Also `./scripts/bundle.sh`, `test -f build/IronPet.app/Contents/Resources/spritesheet.png`, `codesign --verify --verbose build/IronPet.app`, `./scripts/check_adapters.sh build/IronPet.app` |
| `scripts/` | `for script in scripts/*.sh; do bash -n "$script"; done` and `python3 -m py_compile scripts/e2e.py scripts/gen_agent_catalog.py` |
| Docs or skills only | No build gate; check links and paths you mention exist |

`bundle.sh` needs Bun and npm. Never run `./scripts/install.sh`, `./scripts/uninstall.sh`, `./scripts/configure_sentry.sh` or `python3 scripts/e2e.py` while opening a PR unless the user asks: they change the user's installed app, config and agent hooks, and e2e spends agent quota.

## Workflow

1. **Detect the base branch.** Never hardcode `main`:
   - `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`
   - Use the returned name as `<base>` in every command below.

2. **Gather branch state** (run in parallel):
   - `git status`: uncommitted changes. If anything from [Do not commit](#do-not-commit) is staged, stop and ask before continuing.
   - `git diff --stat`: staged and unstaged changes.
   - `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline`: commits on this branch.
   - `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat`: full diff against base.
   - `git branch --show-current`: confirm the branch name. If it is `<base>`, create a branch first (`feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`).
   - `git status -sb` and `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream}`: whether the branch tracks a remote and needs a push.

3. **Ensure a clean, safe tree**:
   - If uncommitted changes belong to this PR, stage and commit them first.
   - If the tree mixes this change with unrelated work, ask before committing.
   - Follow the commit style in `git log --oneline -10`: a lowercase conventional subject (`feat: …`, `fix: …`, `chore: …`, `docs: …`) describing what the user gets, with a short body when needed.
   - Pass the message with a HEREDOC. Do not use `git commit -i`, `--no-verify`, `--amend` (unless the user's amend rules are all met), or force-push.
   - Never update git config.

4. **Analyze all commits** on the branch, not just the latest:
   - Read every commit in `git log <base>..HEAD` and `git diff <base>...HEAD`.
   - Understand the full scope. This drives the title, body, and verification.

5. **Check the docs moved with the code.** A new `config.json` key is in the README's Configuration section; a new file, network destination, credential or permission is in `SECURITY.md`; a design change is in `SPEC.md`. If one is missing, add it (or ask) before opening the PR.

6. **Push the branch.** Never force-push unless the user explicitly asks:
   - `git push -u origin HEAD`

7. **Create the PR** with `gh pr create --base "$BASE"`. Always pass `--body` via a HEREDOC.

8. **Return the PR URL**.

## Do not commit

Stop and ask if any of these are staged:

- Anything from `~/.ironpet` (`token`, `port`, `config.json`, `threads/`, `memory/`, `screenshots/`, `meetings/`), chat transcripts, meeting audio, or screenshots of private screens.
- Tokens and keys: GitHub or Sentry tokens, transcription API keys, `.env` files, signing identities or certificates (`*.p12`, `*.pem`, `*.cer`).
- Build output: `.build/`, `build/`, `.swiftpm/`, `sidecar/out/`, `sidecar/node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`.
- A hand-edited `Sources/IronPet/Chat/ACP/AgentCatalogData.swift` (regenerate with `python3 scripts/gen_agent_catalog.py`).

Do not `git add -f` anything `.gitignore` excludes. `docs/screenshots/` changes only when a README screenshot changed on purpose (render with `./scripts/screenshots.sh`, which uses sample data only).

## PR Title

Format: `<type>: <lowercase description of what the user gets>`, matching the squash-merge commits on `main`.

| Type | When |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New behavior the user can see or turn on |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `chore` | Tooling, CI, scripts, dependencies, agent skills |
| `docs` | README, SPEC, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING only |
| `refactor` | No behavior change |
| `test` | Tests only |

Rules:

- Describe the outcome, not the implementation: `fix: rebuild the mic converter when the input format changes`, not `fix: update AudioSource.swift`.
- Keep it under about 80 characters. GitHub appends ` (#N)` on squash merge.

Examples:

- `feat: offer to record calls when another app uses the microphone`
- `fix: open meeting in the current chat and open files in TextEdit`
- `chore: add review, feature and PR skills for agents`

## PR Body Template

```markdown
## What
<one short paragraph: what the user gets or what was broken and now works, in plain words>

## How
- `<Folder/File.swift>`: <what changed and why it lives there>
- <new setting `key` (default …), in Settings and the README>
- <test hook or e2e scenario added>

## Safety and privacy
<Only when the PR touches hooks, approvals, Auto mode, the local server, files outside `~/.ironpet`, the network, credentials, the microphone or the screen>
- <what it reads, writes or sends, and the default>
- <the SECURITY.md lines added or changed>

## Verification
- [x] `swift build`, `swift test` (<count> tests)
- [x] <bundle and adapters check, if run>
- [x] <installed-app walk-through: what was clicked and seen>
- [ ] <e2e scenarios not run, and why>

<Not verified: what still needs a manual check, with the steps to do it>
```

## Body Writing Rules

### What

- Always include it. Lead with what the user sees: the shortcut, menu item, bubble, or setting, and the default.
- For a fix, say what was broken and when it happened.

### How

- One bullet per owning folder or file, saying why the change lives there.
- Name new `config.json` keys with their default, new `/test/*` endpoints, new e2e scenarios, and anything regenerated.
- Say explicitly when a sensitive area was left untouched if a reviewer might worry (for example "Nothing under `Hooks/` changed").

### Safety and privacy

- Include it whenever the PR changes what ironpet touches on the user's Mac, and omit it otherwise.
- New integrations that use the network or credentials are off by default; say so.

### Verification

- Mark `[x]` only for checks already run in this session. Leave the rest `[ ]` with the reason (for example "uses agent quota", "needs a real call").
- Behavior that only shows in the installed app (hotkeys, Screen Recording, notifications, microphone) is either walked through in `/Applications/IronPet.app` or listed under **Not verified** with steps.
- Name the e2e scenarios that cover the change (see `.cursor/skills/dev-code-review/app.md` › Gates), whether they ran or not.
- UI changes: list the rendered preview paths and tell the user to drag them into the PR, since `gh` cannot upload images.

## Example

A hypothetical feature, to show the shape:

```bash
BASE=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name)

git push -u origin HEAD

gh pr create --base "$BASE" --title "feat: remind me when a watched session has waited for input for a while" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What
When a watched agent session has been in "needs input" for 2 minutes, Ghost shows a second bubble: "Claude Code is still waiting in ironpet." with Jump and Dismiss. Off by default; turn it on under Settings → General → Remind me about waiting agents.

## How
- `Sessions/SessionStore.swift`: records when a session entered `needsInput`; the reminder rule is a plain function so it can be tested.
- `App/Announcer.swift`: the reminder bubble, one per session, replaced rather than stacked.
- New setting `reminders.waitingAgentMinutes` (default 0 = off, clamped to 1–60 when set), in Settings and the README.
- `Tests/IronPetTests/SessionMappingTests.swift`: reminder after the interval, none after the user answers, none while the agents panel is open.
- Nothing under `Hooks/` changed; it uses the events ironpet already receives.

## Verification
- [x] `swift build`, `swift test` (<count> tests)
- [x] Installed app: started a Claude Code session that asked for permission, waited 2 minutes, saw the bubble, Jump opened the iTerm tab.
- [ ] `python3 scripts/e2e.py summaries iterm` (uses agent quota)
EOF
